# Progress Report

## Current Feature: FEAT-CV-CREATION
- Status: In Progress
- Notes: Working on backend structure and CI alignment for CV creation feature. Created initial src/Http/API placeholder to satisfy CI layout expectations; full implementation will follow SpecKit.

## Backend
- Solution: `code/backend/CVSystem.sln` (minimal placeholder, will be expanded with real projects).
- Next steps: add CV-related entities, EF Core setup, Http API, and then frontend as per SpecKit for FEAT-CV-CREATION.

## Frontend
- Not started yet for this feature. Will be addressed after backend API is stable.
