# Progress Report

## Global Status
- Current Feature: FEAT-CV-CREATION
- Status: In Progress
- Last CI Result: Failed (attempt 1 for FEAT-CV-CREATION)

## Notes
- CI is currently failing on backend build due to missing namespaces/types (e.g., Volo.* in AccountController, some DTOs in CVController).
- Next steps: fix compilation issues in backend controllers/DTOs, then re-run CI.
