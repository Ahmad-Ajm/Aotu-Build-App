# Progress Report

## Current Feature: FEAT-CV-CREATION
- Status: In Progress
- Notes: Starting implementation of CV creation feature. Backend domain/EFCore setup will be implemented first, then HTTP API, then frontend in a later step.

## Backend
- Solution: `code/backend/CVSystem.sln` (placeholder, will be expanded with real projects).
- Next steps: add CV-related entities and services (Domain + EntityFrameworkCore + HttpApi) according to SpecKit for FEAT-CV-CREATION.

## Frontend
- Not started yet for this feature. Will be addressed after backend API is stable.
